# NLP Applications for Amazon Books Reviews

### Collaborators: Dhruv Shah, Jenn Hong, Santiago Mazzei, Victor Floriano

This project delved into the utilization of NLP techniques for analyzing Amazon book reviews. When product reviews are cluttered or disorganized, it can make it difficult for shoppers to find relevant information and make informed purchasing decisions. This can lead to decreased trust in the platform, and potentially loss in sales for sellers.

Our chosen approach begins with performing clustering to reveal initial insights, particularly aimed at Market Segmentation and Profiling through the book reviews. To achieve this, we applied KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering methods, organizing the reviews based on varied criteria such as price, votes, and the total number of reviews a book has received. 

Building upon this foundation, we've expanded our exploration into the realm of text mining and sentiment analysis. This step not only deepens our understanding of the underlying sentiments expressed within reviews—categorizing them into positive and negative sentiments—but also provides summary statistics that reflect the overall sentiment associated with each book.

Through clustering, we identified two groups of power users, those with high verification and those who purchase books at high prices, which can be utilized for customer segmentation and targeting. Via sentiment analysis, we identified top genres, book styles, and titles, which can be fed into recommendation algorithms for marketing strategies, content recommendations, and product development. Moreover, these insights could influence publishing houses' production decisions regarding the styles of books they choose to produce. Further exploration into specific book categories or sentiment patterns could yield deeper understanding and actionable recommendations. These sentiment scores can also be used in the review interface to give prospective buyers more insights on the book overall.
